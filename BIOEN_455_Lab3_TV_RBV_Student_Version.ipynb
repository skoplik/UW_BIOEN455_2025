    "The objective of this computational lab is to explore the design and behavior of capillaric circuits (CCs), specifically focusing on flow resistors, retention burst valves (RBVs) and trigger valves (TVs), to enable the autonomous and sequential delivery of liquids. **Based on the paper: [Autonomous microfluidic capillaric circuits replicated from 3D-printed molds](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/lc/c6lc00764c)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "From videos of CCs (Olanrewaju et al 2016), you will record the drain time of liquids in reservoirs connected to Retention Burst Valves (RBVs) and Trigger Valves (TVs). You will later calculate the junction pressures, exploring the theory behind using TVs and RBVs for autonomous sequential delivery of four liquids.\n",
