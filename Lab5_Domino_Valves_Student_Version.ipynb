    "### Materials\n",
    "- Resin-printed microfluidic chip, plasma treated, and sealed with hydrophobic cover tape (ARseal 90697, Adhesives Research, Glen Rock, Pennsylvania, USA)\n",
    "- Red and yellow dye solutions (13% food dye v/v in DI water). \n",
    "- P20 Micropipettes and tips\n",
    "- Paper pump\n",
    "- Kim wipes (for cleaning up)\n",
    "- Gloves\n",
    "- Timer or stopwatch\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure (read fully before starting)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Glove Up:** Wear gloves as part of standard lab safety and best practices. All the materials we’re working with, are not really hazardous. That said, it’s still best practice to wear gloves during handling—especially since we have no idea where these pipettes have been! 😊\n",
    "2. **QC:**\n",
    "   - Double-check that all channels are properly sealed with cover tapes and dye solution is mixed before starting.\n",
    "   - Work in your petri dish and avoid tipping the chip (the dye may spill and stain whatever it touches)\n",
    "3. **Paper Pump:** Attach a paper pump to the outlet of the CC. You may need to put pressure on it so that it connects to the outlet.\n",
    "4. **Filling Reservoirs:** Using a P20 pipette, you should introduce liquid into channels until they are filled. Try your best not to overfill or underfill the channels. We have provided a starting place for volumes to use, but these may need to be modified. Introduce ~12µL of the **red** dye solution into the inlet of reservoir 1. Introduce ~10 µL of the **red** dye solution into the inlet of reservoirs 2-3. \n",
    "5. **Filling Control Channel:** Using a  pipette, introduce ~13µL of the **yellow** dye solution into the inlet of the control channel. Note that once you add liquid to the control channel the flow will begin, so you should be ready with your timer!\n",
    "6. **Timing:** Start the timer as soon as the red dye solution begins draining from each reservoir. We recommend using a lap function to more easily record the time stamps of sequential drainage. Alternatively, you can take a video with your phone of the drainage process and review the footage to obtain time stamps. If you go the video route, ensure you have enough storage to record a full video!\n",
    "8. **Recording:** Record the time taken for each reservoir to drain. We suggest recording these times both in this notebook (in the table below) AND elsewhere to avoid any data loss. If your channel failed, note the modes of failure and mention this in your reflection question 3.\n",
    "9. **Flow Rates:** Using the volumes provided and the measured drain times, calculate the flow rates for each reservoir.\n",

    "\n",
