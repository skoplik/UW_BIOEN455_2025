    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "Understand the principles of flow resistance, capillary pressure, and volume in microfluidic devices. Analyze the behavior of simple microchannels using this Python script and compare the experimental measurements of drain time to the theoretical ones determined computationally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "- Part 0 (hands-on experiments), should be done first, as there is some waiting time involved.\n",
    "- Complete code anywhere with a \"TODO:\" marked.\n",
    "- Parts 1-5 should be done in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Guidelines\n",
    "- Put your name and date in the next cell \n",
    "- When finished, download and submit your modified script on Canvas as pdf (File> Save and Export Notebook As > PDF)\n",
    "- <font color=\"red\">Answer reflection questions (in red). This can be completed after lab.</font> You can type this in a markdown within this script, or submit them as a separate file.\n",
    "- Use plots or graphs wherever applicable to support your explanations.\n"
